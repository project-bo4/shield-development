## SHIELD
A very experimental modification platform for Call of Duty®: Black Ops 4 run by community, aiming at improving both functionality and performance of original game.


## DEMONWARE
As of May11, 2023 we merged 'demonware' branch into 'master'. it includes a built-in demonware server emulator which allows player to start game without connection to official online servers.


## INSTRUCTION
-- you should have publisher files required for play online under LPC folder of your game installation. if its not the case then start original game through battlenet launcher once to get those downloaded.

1- clone repository with its sub-modules and use generate.bat to make visual studio solution then compile project and copy ``d3d11.dll`` into your bo4 folder.

2- start BlackOps4.exe

## SHIELD
A very experimental modification platform for Call of DutyÂ®: Black Ops 4 run by the community, aiming at improving both functionality and performance of the original game.


## DEMONWARE
As of May 11, 2023, we have merged the 'demonware' branch into 'master'. It includes a built-in demonware server emulator which allows the player to start a game without an active connection to the official online servers.


## INSTRUCTIONS

> You should already have the publisher files required for playing online (found under the LPC folder of your game directory).
> If this is not the case, then run Black Ops 4 through Battle.NET Launcher once to get those files downloaded.

1- Clone repository with its sub-modules and use ```generate.bat``` to make a Visual Studio solution, then compile project and copy ``d3d11.dll`` into your BO4 folder.

2- Start BlackOps4.exe

*In case you wanted to revert back to using the original Battle.NET servers, just delete the generated ``d3d11.dll`` file from your game folder. You can re-generate and copy ```d3d11.dll``` back later whenever you want to re-install the client.*

## SHIELD
A very experimental modification platform for Call of DutyÂ®: Black Ops 4 run by community, aiming at improving both functionality and performance of original game.


## DEMONWARE
As of May11, 2023 we merged 'demonware' branch into 'master'. it includes a built-in demonware server emulator which allows player to start game without connection to official online servers.


## INSTRUCTIONS

> You should have publisher files required for playing online under LPC folder of your game directory.
> If its not the case then start original game through battlenet launcher once to get those downloaded.

1- Clone repository with its sub-modules and use generate.bat to make visual studio solution then compile project and copy ``d3d11.dll`` into your bo4 folder.

2- Start BlackOps4.exe

*In case you wanted to revert back to original battlenet servers just delete ``d3d11.dll``. you can put it back later whenever you want to re-install client.*
